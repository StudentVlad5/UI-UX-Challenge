# Single Widget Page Implementation Plan

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation plan for the Single Widget Page. This document outlines navigation from the Widget List Page, component breakdown, state management, data fetching, and performance considerations. The implementation follows the UI/UX design from Figma (1536px viewport) and adheres to the specified tech stack.

## Tech Stack

Framework: Next.js
Language: TypeScript
Styling: SCSS, Tailwind CSS
Accessibility: React Aria
State Management: Redux Toolkit (RTK Query)
Version Control: Git

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

# Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/single-widget-page.git
    cd single-widget-page

# Install dependencies
    npm install  # or yarn install

# Running the Project

To start the development server, run:
    npm run dev  # or yarn dev
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Sub-Task Breakdown

### 1. Routing & Navigation

Implement dynamic routing using Next.js (pages/widget/[id].tsx).
Use useRouter to extract the widget ID from the URL.
Link widgets from Widget_List_Page to Single_Widget_Page.

### 2. Component Breakdown

## Global Components

### Header (Header Component)

Icons: Logo, Clock.
Buttons: Menu items, Create.
SearchPanel: Search functionality in the navigation bar.

### Widget List Page (Main Page Component)

WidgetList
Item: Displays metadata (Name, Rating, Price, Tags, Likes, Requests).
Single Widget Page (Main Page Component)

### WidgetDetailsPage

WidgetInfo: Displays metadata (Views, Rating, Tags, etc.).
DownloadButton: Displays downloadable files (e.g., PDFs).
UserComments: Displays user comments and interaction options.
CommentsSection: Allows users to purchase or acquire the widget.
Chat Contents:

Header: Displays user details, date, and time.
Content: Displays user messages.
Footer: Includes Like/Dislike and Reply buttons.

### Reusable Components

Breadcrumbs.tsx
RatingStars.tsx
TagList.tsx
CommentSection.tsx
LikesRate.tsx
Price.tsx
DownloadButton.tsx

### 3. State Management & Data Fetching

Fetch widget details using RTK Query (useGetWidgetQuery(widgetId)).
Store user interactions (Ratings, Comments, Likes) in Redux state.
Handle API caching and optimistic updates for a smooth user experience.

### 4. UI/UX Considerations

Ensure full responsiveness with Tailwind CSS (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile).
Maintain accessibility using React Aria.
Implement skeleton loaders for a smoother user experience during API calls.
Use hover effects and animations as per Figma design guidelines.

### 5. Performance & Testing

Performance Optimization
- Use Next.js Static Site Generation (SSG) where applicable.
- Optimize images using the Next.js Image component.
- Enable lazy loading for comments and other non-critical elements.
- Implement Google Analytics for tracking.
- Set up Google Search Console for SEO optimization.
- Implement breadcrumbs for improved navigation and SEO.
- Use structured data (Schema.org JSON-LD) to enhance search engine indexing.
- Define meta tags dynamically using next/head.
Testing Approach
- Unit tests with Jest & React Testing Library.
- Integration tests for API calls and state management.
- End-to-end tests using Cypress for user interactions.

### 6. Estimated Timeline

|Task                            | Time Estimate     |
|Setup routing & navigation      | 1 day             |
|Implement components            | 2 days            |
|State management & data fetching| 2 days            |
|Styling & responsiveness        | 2 days            |
| Testing & bug fixes            |  2 days           |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
|Total Estimate                  |  9 days           |

### 7. Potential Blockers & Required Information

## Potential Blockers

-- Unclear API structure for widget details and comments.
-- Handling authentication for commenting and purchasing.
-- Rate limits or caching policies for API requests.
-- Handling unauthorized users who do not have a name when submitting a review or like.
-- New computer for the developer.

## Additional Information Needed

API documentation for widget details and comments.
Expected behavior for unauthenticated users (e.g., Can they comment or like?).
Hover states and animations confirmation from the design team.
Search parameters and filtering logic.
Sorting criteria (e.g., by rating, popularity, newest).
Pagination strategy for comment sections and widget lists.
Multilingual support and language switching behavior.
Customer support system (e.g., live chat, FAQ).
Logic for the "Create" button and Clock icon functionality.
Timezone handling for timestamps in comments and user activity.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This document provides a structured implementation plan for the Single Widget Page, covering routing, component architecture, state management, UI/UX considerations, performance optimizations, and testing.

By addressing potential blockers early and gathering the required information, we ensure a smooth development process that aligns with the Figma design and project requirements. ðŸš€
